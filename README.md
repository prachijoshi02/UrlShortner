# URL Shortener Project

## Overview
This project implements a URL shortener service that converts long URLs into short, easy-to-share links. The application is built using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. It offers the following key features:
- **URL shortening**: Take a long URL and generate a short, unique link.
- **Redirection**: Redirect users from the short link to the original URL.

The project solves the problem of easily sharing long URLs by generating shorter, more manageable versions of them.
